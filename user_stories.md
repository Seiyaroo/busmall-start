As a user I want to be able to come to the website and be able to complete my determined goal within a few minutes of the site. 

As a user, the site should be readable and easy to understand what needs to be done to achieve my goal.

As a developer I want to be able to design a well structured site that functions cleanly behind the scenes.

As a developer I want to manage my code through an online version control system so others can manage their own systems forked off my own, or for me and my team to manage online as a form of version control.

As a user who stumbled on the site, I would like some interactivity on the site that keeps me focused on the website and entertained for my duration there.
